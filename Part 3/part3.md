**DevTools - Debugging**

- What was the bug?

  The bug was that `num1` and `num2` were strings. When these two variables were added, the concatenation operation was called instead of addition which resulted in the return value to be `${num1}${num2}` ('1' + ‘2’ == ‘12’）instead of `num1 + num2`.

- How would you fix it? Include a screenshot of your fix.

  Convert the types of num1 and num2. In fix.png
